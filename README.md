# Advent of Code
https://adventofcode.com

These are my solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles.

I was introduced to Advent of Code in 2021 and quickly fell in love with the event.

Working through the puzzles has helped me develop both my Python skills and my algorithmic problem-solving abilities. I don’t use auto-suggestions or Co-Pilot assistance for these challenges, as that would defeat the purpose. (For reference, large language models can generate solutions to past years with just “Solve Day 1 of 2021 AoC.” Clearly lots of AoC solutions, just like this repo, in the training data.)

In 2024, I impressed myself by earning 47 ⭐, missing only Part 2 of Days 17 and 24. As you’ll see from my solutions, I’ve also gone back to earlier years to enjoy more puzzles.
